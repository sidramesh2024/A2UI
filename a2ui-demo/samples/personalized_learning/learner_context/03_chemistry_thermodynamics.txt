WHAT IS THERMODYNAMICS?
-----------------------

Thermodynamics is the study of relationships between energy and work in chemical and physical processes. It tells us:
- Whether a reaction will happen spontaneously
- How much energy is involved
- Which direction a reaction will go

SPONTANEOUS PROCESSES
---------------------

A spontaneous process occurs naturally without continuous external energy input.

Important: "Spontaneous" does NOT mean "fast." It means the process is thermodynamically favorable - the system naturally moves in that direction.

Examples of spontaneous processes:
- Ice melting at room temperature
- A ball rolling downhill
- Iron rusting
- ATP hydrolysis to ADP + Pi

What makes a process spontaneous? The system moves toward greater stability (lower free energy).

ENTHALPY (ΔH)
-------------

Enthalpy change measures heat absorbed or released at constant pressure.

- Negative ΔH = EXOTHERMIC = releases heat
- Positive ΔH = ENDOTHERMIC = absorbs heat

Calculation: ΔH = (Energy to break bonds in reactants) - (Energy released forming bonds in products)

If products have stronger bonds than reactants, ΔH is negative (exothermic).

ENTROPY (ΔS)
------------

Entropy is a measure of disorder or dispersal of energy and matter.

- Systems tend toward higher entropy (more disorder)
- Positive ΔS = increase in disorder = favorable
- Negative ΔS = decrease in disorder = unfavorable

Examples:
- Gas expanding into vacuum → entropy increases (favorable)
- Ice melting to liquid → entropy increases (favorable)
- Organizing a messy room → entropy decreases (requires energy input)

GIBBS FREE ENERGY (ΔG) - THE KEY CONCEPT
----------------------------------------

Gibbs Free Energy combines enthalpy and entropy to predict spontaneity:

    ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

Where:
- ΔG = Gibbs free energy change
- ΔH = enthalpy change
- T = temperature (in Kelvin)
- ΔS = entropy change

THE RULE:
- ΔG < 0 (negative) → SPONTANEOUS (favorable, releases free energy)
- ΔG > 0 (positive) → NON-SPONTANEOUS (unfavorable, requires energy input)
- ΔG = 0 → AT EQUILIBRIUM

WHAT DOES NEGATIVE ΔG REALLY MEAN?
----------------------------------

When ΔG is negative, the PRODUCTS have LOWER FREE ENERGY than the REACTANTS.

Lower free energy = more stable

So a spontaneous reaction (negative ΔG) is one where the products are more stable than the reactants. Energy is released because the system moves "downhill" energetically to a more stable state.

This is NOT because energy was "stored" somewhere and got released. It's because stability increased, and that stability difference manifests as released energy.

THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
--------------------------------

All spontaneous processes increase the entropy of the universe.

For a process to be spontaneous:
- Either it releases enough heat to compensate for any entropy decrease
- Or it increases entropy enough to compensate for any heat absorbed
- Or both (exothermic AND entropy increase = definitely spontaneous)

ATP HYDROLYSIS IN THERMODYNAMIC TERMS
-------------------------------------

ATP + H2O → ADP + Pi

ΔG° ≈ -30.5 kJ/mol (under cellular conditions)

This negative ΔG tells us:
- The reaction is SPONTANEOUS
- Products (ADP + Pi) are MORE STABLE than reactants (ATP)
- Energy is released because the system moves to a lower energy state

The -30.5 kJ/mol is NOT "energy stored in the phosphate bond."
It is the FREE ENERGY DIFFERENCE between ATP and its products.

WHY IS ADP + Pi MORE STABLE THAN ATP?
-------------------------------------

Several factors make the products lower in free energy:

1. ELECTROSTATIC REPULSION
   - ATP has four negative charges crowded on three phosphate groups
   - These negative charges repel each other
   - Hydrolysis separates these charges, reducing repulsion
   - Less repulsion = more stable = lower energy

2. RESONANCE STABILIZATION
   - Inorganic phosphate (Pi) has excellent resonance stabilization
   - More resonance structures = more stable electron distribution
   - ADP also has better resonance than ATP

3. SOLVATION (HYDRATION)
   - ADP and Pi are better stabilized by surrounding water molecules
   - Better solvation = lower energy = more stable

Combined, these factors make ADP + Pi about 30.5 kJ/mol more stable than ATP under cellular conditions.

THE COMPRESSED SPRING ANALOGY
-----------------------------

Think of ATP like a COMPRESSED SPRING, not like a battery:

Compressed spring:
- High potential energy (strained state)
- Unstable, wants to release
- Energy not "stored in the metal"
- Energy is in the CONFIGURATION

When spring releases:
- Moves to relaxed state
- Lower potential energy (stable state)
- Can do work during transition

Similarly, ATP:
- High free energy (strained molecular configuration)
- Unstable due to charge repulsion
- Energy not "stored in bonds"
- Energy is in the unstable CONFIGURATION

When ATP hydrolyzes:
- Moves to stable state (ADP + Pi)
- Lower free energy
- Releases ~30.5 kJ/mol that can do cellular work

KEY TAKEAWAYS
-------------

1. ΔG (Gibbs Free Energy) determines spontaneity
2. Negative ΔG means products are MORE STABLE than reactants
3. Energy is released when systems move toward stability
4. ATP hydrolysis has ΔG = -30.5 kJ/mol because ADP + Pi is more stable
5. This is NOT "energy stored in bonds" - it's a stability difference
6. The compressed spring is a better analogy than a battery
