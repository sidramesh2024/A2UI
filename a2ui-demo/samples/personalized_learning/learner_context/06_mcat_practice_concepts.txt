MCAT PRACTICE: BOND ENERGY AND THERMODYNAMICS
==============================================

This document contains the key concepts and question patterns Maria should master for MCAT success.

CORE MCAT CONCEPTS
------------------

1. BOND ENERGY IS ENERGY REQUIRED TO BREAK A BOND
   - Always positive (endothermic)
   - Higher bond energy = stronger bond = more stable
   - Breaking bonds costs energy; forming bonds releases energy

2. ENTHALPY OF REACTION (ΔH)
   ΔH = Σ(bond energies broken) - Σ(bond energies formed)

   - If ΔH < 0: Exothermic (more energy released forming bonds than consumed breaking bonds)
   - If ΔH > 0: Endothermic (more energy consumed breaking bonds than released forming bonds)

3. GIBBS FREE ENERGY (ΔG)
   ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

   - If ΔG < 0: Spontaneous (products more stable than reactants)
   - If ΔG > 0: Non-spontaneous (products less stable than reactants)
   - If ΔG = 0: At equilibrium

4. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STABILITY AND ENERGY
   - Lower energy = more stable
   - Spontaneous reactions move toward stability (lower ΔG)
   - Energy is released when systems become more stable

COMMON MCAT QUESTION TYPES
--------------------------

TYPE 1: Calculate ΔH from bond energies

Example:
Given: C-H = 414 kJ/mol, O=O = 498 kJ/mol, C=O = 803 kJ/mol, O-H = 464 kJ/mol

Calculate ΔH for: CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O

Solution:
Bonds broken: 4(C-H) + 2(O=O) = 4(414) + 2(498) = 2652 kJ
Bonds formed: 2(C=O) + 4(O-H) = 2(803) + 4(464) = 3462 kJ
ΔH = 2652 - 3462 = -810 kJ/mol (exothermic)

Key insight: More energy released forming products than consumed breaking reactants.

TYPE 2: Predict spontaneity

Example:
A reaction has ΔH = +50 kJ/mol and ΔS = +200 J/mol·K. At what temperature does it become spontaneous?

Solution:
Spontaneous when ΔG < 0
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS < 0
ΔH < TΔS
T > ΔH/ΔS = 50,000 J / 200 J/K = 250 K

Above 250 K, the entropy increase overcomes the positive enthalpy.

TYPE 3: Compare stability

Example:
Why is ATP hydrolysis spontaneous?

WRONG answer: "Because energy stored in the phosphate bond is released"
CORRECT answer: "Because the products (ADP + Pi) are more thermodynamically stable than ATP due to reduced electrostatic repulsion, increased resonance stabilization, and improved solvation"

TYPE 4: Coupled reactions

Example:
Given: ATP hydrolysis: ΔG = -30.5 kJ/mol
       Glutamine synthesis: ΔG = +14.2 kJ/mol

Is the coupled reaction spontaneous?

Solution:
ΔG_total = -30.5 + 14.2 = -16.3 kJ/mol
Yes, spontaneous (negative ΔG)

ATP hydrolysis drives the otherwise unfavorable synthesis.

CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS
---------------------

BOND ENERGY vs. STABILITY
- High bond energy = strong bond = stable molecule
- It takes MORE energy to break strong bonds
- Strong bonds don't "store" more energy - they're just harder to break

EXOTHERMIC vs. SPONTANEOUS
- Exothermic (ΔH < 0): Releases heat
- Spontaneous (ΔG < 0): Thermodynamically favorable

A reaction can be:
- Exothermic AND spontaneous (most common for favorable reactions)
- Endothermic AND spontaneous (if TΔS is large enough)
- Exothermic AND non-spontaneous (if TΔS is negative enough)

BREAKING vs. FORMING BONDS
- Breaking bonds: ALWAYS requires energy (endothermic step)
- Forming bonds: ALWAYS releases energy (exothermic step)
- Net effect depends on the balance

ATP-SPECIFIC MCAT POINTS
------------------------

1. ATP hydrolysis ΔG° ≈ -30.5 kJ/mol under standard conditions

2. Why is ATP high-energy?
   - Electrostatic repulsion between phosphate groups
   - NOT because the P-O bond is "weak" or "stores energy"

3. Why is ADP + Pi more stable?
   - Charge separation reduces repulsion
   - Better resonance in phosphate ion
   - Better hydration of products

4. ATP coupling
   - Spontaneous ATP hydrolysis can drive non-spontaneous reactions
   - Combined ΔG must be negative for the coupled reaction to proceed

5. ATP is constantly recycled
   - Humans produce ~40 kg ATP per day
   - Same ATP molecules recycled thousands of times
   - ATP ↔ ADP + Pi is a cycle, not a one-way consumption

PRACTICE QUESTION FOR MARIA
---------------------------

Question:
A student claims that "ATP is a high-energy molecule because it stores a lot of energy in its phosphate bonds, which is released when the bonds break."

Which of the following best corrects this misconception?

A) ATP bonds are actually weak and break easily, releasing stored energy.
B) Breaking any chemical bond requires energy input; ATP hydrolysis releases energy because the products are more thermodynamically stable.
C) ATP has more electrons than ADP, which is why breaking it releases energy.
D) The energy comes from the adenine base, not the phosphate groups.

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Breaking bonds ALWAYS requires energy input (positive bond dissociation energy). ATP hydrolysis releases energy because ADP + Pi (the products) are in a lower free energy state than ATP (more stable). This is due to reduced electrostatic repulsion, better resonance stabilization, and improved solvation - NOT because energy was "stored in" the bond.

SUMMARY FOR MARIA
-----------------

Remember these key points for MCAT:

1. Breaking bonds = costs energy (always)
2. Forming bonds = releases energy (always)
3. Net ΔH = bonds broken - bonds formed
4. ΔG determines spontaneity (negative = spontaneous)
5. ATP releases energy because products are MORE STABLE
6. "High-energy bond" means the MOLECULE is unstable, not that the bond stores energy
7. Compressed spring analogy > battery analogy
