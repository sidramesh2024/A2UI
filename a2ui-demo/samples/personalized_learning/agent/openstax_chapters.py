Complete OpenStax Biology AP Courses Chapter Index

This module provides a comprehensive mapping of all chapters in the OpenStax
Biology for AP Courses textbook, along with topic-to-chapter matching.

Content is sourced from the OpenStax GitHub repository:
https://github.com/openstax/osbooks-biology-bundle

The module IDs (e.g., m62767) correspond to CNXML files in the modules/ directory.

NOTE ON KEYWORD MATCHING APPROACH:
-----------------------------------
The KEYWORD_HINTS dictionary below uses a simple keyword-based approach to map
user topics to textbook chapters. This is admittedly naive and could be improved
with more sophisticated techniques (semantic search, embeddings, etc.). However,
content retrieval is not the main focus of this A2UI demo - we're demonstrating
the agent-to-UI rendering pipeline, not building a production content system.
For a real application, consider using vector embeddings or a proper search index.
