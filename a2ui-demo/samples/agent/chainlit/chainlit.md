# Chainlit + Gemini Chat

A minimal chat application using Chainlit and Google Gemini. This example is designed for **comparison with the A2UI Simple Chat** (`samples/agent/adk/simple_chat`).

## Try it

Type a message below to start a conversation. The assistant uses Gemini for responses and maintains conversation history within this session.

## Comparison

See `samples/agent/adk/simple_chat/HOW_IT_WORKS.md` for a detailed comparison of A2UI vs Chainlit (and Streamlit, Gradio) across architecture, security, customization, and more.
